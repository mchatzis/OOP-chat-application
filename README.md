# A chat processor

## Motivation
This project was part of my self-learning plan of learning software design that abides by the S.O.L.I.D. design principles.

My plan was to follow the following processes in parallel:
  Theory: Read through Robert C. Martin's (Uncle Bob's) books on Clean Architecture and Software Craftsmanship
  Practice: Implement concepts learnt from theory in my OOP-chat application

My plan worked and this github repository is the archive of the end result.
