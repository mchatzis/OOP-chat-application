# A chat processor

## Motivation
This project was part of my plan of self-learning software design that abides by the S.O.L.I.D. design principles.

My plan was to follow the following processes in parallel:
  - Theory: Read through Robert C. Martin's (Uncle Bob's) books on Clean Architecture and Software Craftsmanship
  - Practice: Implement concepts learnt from theory in my OOP-chat application

My plan worked and this github repository is the archive of the end result.

## Next Project and why this project is still being updated
My next project is going to be focusing on Test Driven Development. 
However, an intermediate milestone before beginning that is to improve my unit testing skills.

Therefore, I have been writing unit tests for this project, although testing was outside the scope of my initial plan for this project. Due to this fact, one may notice that this project is still being updated (with tests). 

## Documentation
### What the program is and does

This program is a very simple text file processor. 
It reads from a text file, it processes the information and it outputs the product of processing into another output file.

### Reading from a text file ###

The program reads from a '.txt' file. The text to be read has to have a specific format, which represents a conversation of people in a chat application.
The format follows:
(10 digit number) (non-empty sequence of characters) (non-empty sequence of characters)

representing...

(timestamp of message) (sender) (message sent)

### Processing

### Exporting end product
